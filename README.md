## SJF Algorithm Visualizer

- This is a basic example of the SJF operating system algorithm.
- assumes all processes arrive at the same time in a batch

### Functionality

- SJF => Shortest Job First

  - Targets the shortest job in a process.
  - When supplied with values it will search out for the shortest to complete job and then move on the the next.
  - (**Not yet implemented**) Arrival time of jobs is taken into account
    - if a job takes 10s to finish and the next shortest job is added 5s into the process then when the current process is finished that job will be next
